i.MX6 cpufreq driver
-------------------

i.MX6 SoC cpufreq driver for CPU frequency scaling.

This binding doc defines properties that must be put in the /cpus/cpu@0 node,
please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/cpufreq/cpufreq-cpu0.txt
for detail.

Required properties:
- operating-points: Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
  for details.
- clocks: Specify clocks that need to be used when cpu frequency is scaled,
  refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for
  details.
- clock-names: List of clock input name strings sorted in the same order as the
  clocks property, refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
  for details.
- xxx-supply: Input voltage supply regulator, refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for details.
  arm-supply: regulator node supplying arm.
  pu-supply: regulator node supplying pu.
  soc-supply: regulator node supplying soc.

Optional properties:
- fsl,soc-operating-points: Specify vddsoc/pu voltage settings that must
  go with cpu0's operating-points.
- clock-latency: Specify the possible maximum transition latency for clock,
  in unit of nanoseconds.

Examples:

	cpu@0 {
		operating-points = <
			/* kHz    uV */
			1200000 1275000
			996000  1250000
			792000  1150000
			396000  975000
		>;
		fsl,soc-operating-points = <
			/* ARM kHz  SOC-PU uV */
			1200000 1275000
			996000	1250000
			792000	1175000
			396000	1175000
		>;
		clock-latency = <61036>; /* two CLK32 periods */
		clocks = <&clks 104>, <&clks 6>, <&clks 16>,
			 <&clks 17>, <&clks 170>;
		clock-names = "arm", "pll2_pfd2_396m", "step",
			      "pll1_sw", "pll1_sys";
		arm-supply = <&reg_arm>;
		pu-supply = <&reg_pu>;
		soc-supply = <&reg_soc>;
	};
